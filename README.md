# MMM-MJPG-stream
Display a MJPEG Stream from a Rasperry Pi in Magic Mirror 2.

This is made to my specific needs for two cams, but with a little tweaking it might be useful for others as well.

Set to update once per minute, so it will come back up if the stream goes offline for a while without needing to reboot the mirror itself.
